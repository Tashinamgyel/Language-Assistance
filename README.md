# languageassistance
i have a chinese friend who is learning english and has a hard time with the english vocabulary. So i made this english learning assistance app that will help her in learning english words and noting it down with the app. 
She can write down/ save the words that she have learned, and the app will fetch its meaning and example usage.
This is done through API calling.

For this app i have used OpenAI's API.

The app can also generate quizes for the words that she have saved, for better learning reinforcement.
